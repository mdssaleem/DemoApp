# PokemonApp

## Overview

PokemonApp is a simple SwiftUI-based list-detail application that fetches and displays a list of 100 Pokémon using the PokéAPI. It provides a sidebar to display Pokémon names and a detail view that shows more information about the selected Pokémon. Users can toggle between sorting the list alphabetically and by ID number. This project demonstrates the integration of SwiftUI with Combine for asynchronous data fetching, navigation, and basic unit testing.

## Features

- When selecting a name from the sidebar, the app fetches and displays additional information about the Pokémon, including their name, ID, base experience, and abilities.
- Includes working previews for each SwiftUI view.
